                <p>Hey guys, My name is Mustafa, I am 27 years old, born and raised in Louisiana and currently reside in Dallas,TX.</p>
                <p>I am a young developer thats always continuing to learn about new technologies and constantly sharpening the tools in my arsenal to improve my skills.</p>
                <p>When i am not working you can find me tinkering with car lego sets as well as model cars, In the gym trying to become Greek God and lifting heavy metal objects for many hours, or in the kitchen trying to pretend I'm the next Gordon Ramsey yelling at my cat as if she is one of my assistant chefs.</p>
                <p>The main reason i love my job is the continuation of challenges and obstacles that coding provides, every coding issue is never the same but the challenge to solve it is always as exciting. Plus im always trying to learn something new.</p>
